    <h3 id="tribute_page">A tribute page</h3>
    <p>
      This is one of the most simple HTML projects you can make. As you can
      guess by the name, a tribute page shows respect for someone who inspires
      you, or someone you admire and revere. To make a tribute page, you only
      need to know fundamental HTML concepts.
    </p>

    <h3 id="survey_form">A survey form</h3>
    <p>
      Websites often include forms as a part of their customer data collection
      strategy. A well-made survey form can help you acquire relevant
      information about your target audiences like their demographic age, job,
      location, taste and preference, and pain points. This HTML project is a
      great way to test your skills and knowledge of designing forms and
      structuring a webpage.

    <h3 id="tech_page">Technical documentation page</h3>
    <p>
      You can build a technical documentation page if you have the basic
      knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main idea behind this project
      is to create a technical documentation page wherein you can click on any
      topic on the left side of the page, and it will load the associated
      content on the right.
    </p>

    <h3 id="landing_page">Landing page</h3>
    <p>
      This project requires a strong knowledge of HTML and CSS. Since a landing
      page includes numerous vital elements, you will have to combine your HTML
      knowledge with your creative skills.
    </p>

    <h3 id="event_page">Event page</h3>
    <p>
      This is another easy project that you can experiment with! It will involve
      creating a static page displaying the details of an event (conference,
      webinar, product launch, etc.). You will need both HTML and CSS for this
      project.
